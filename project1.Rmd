## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
---
creating a tidy data set
```{r tidy}
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv")
activity$date <- as.POSIXct(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
weekday <- weekdays(activity$date)
activity <- cbind(activity,weekday)

```
a histogram of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r making histogram}
activity_total_steps<-with(activity,(aggregate(steps, by=list(date), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE ) ) )
names(activity_total_steps)<-c("date","steps")
hist(activity_total_steps$steps, main = "Total number of steps taken in a day")

```
---
calculating the mean and the median of the total number of steps taken in a day

```{r mean and median}
mean(activity_total_steps$steps)
median(activity_total_steps$steps)

```
---
plotting the average daily activity pattern
```{r avg daily activity}
average_daily_activity<- with(activity,(aggregate(steps, by=list(interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE ) ) )
names(average_daily_activity)<-c("interval","mean_steps")
plot(average_daily_activity$interval, average_daily_activity$mean_steps, type='l',xlab = "Interval",ylab = "Mean Steps Taken",main = "Average Daily Activity")

```
---
calculating the maximum number of steps
```{r max steps}
average_daily_activity[which.max(average_daily_activity$mean_steps),]$interval

```
---
calculating the number of missing values
```{r calulating missing values}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))

```
---
imputing missing values
```{r impute missing values}
imputed_steps <- average_daily_activity$mean_steps[match(activity$interval,average_daily_activity$interval)]

activity_imputed <- transform(activity, steps = ifelse(is.na(activity$steps), yes = imputed_steps, no = activity$steps))
total_steps_imputed <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity_imputed, sum)
names(total_steps_imputed) <- c("date", "daily_steps")
```
---creating a histogram plot for total number of steps taken in a day
```{r}
hist(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps,main="Total number of steps taken in a day",xlab = "Daily Steps")
```
---
the mean and the median of steps taken per day
```{r}
mean(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps)
median(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps)
```

---
finding differences in patterns of weekdays and weekends

```{r}
activity$date <- as.Date(strptime(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d"))
activity$datetype <- sapply(activity$date, function(x) {
        if (weekdays(x) == "Saturday" | weekdays(x) =="Sunday") 
                {y <- "Weekend"} else 
                {y <- "Weekday"}
                y
        })

```
making a plot of the differences
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
activity_by_date <- aggregate(steps~interval + datetype, activity, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot<- qplot(interval,steps,facets = .~datetype, data = activity_by_date,geom = "line")
print(plot)
```




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
